Hi, I'm Albin Gilles, I'm 28, I live in Belgium. Welcome to my blog, where I'll explain what I learn, why and how.

To describe me in a few words, I'm a _Software Engineer_ and _DevOps_ aspirant. I earned a Master Of Computer Sciences degree at the University of Mons, Belgium in 2011.

I love mountain biking and my biggest passion is to build _self-sufficient systems_. I used to be an hardcore gamer but since a few years, I'm only following esport competition once in a while.

My major interests in computer sciences are server-side technology, massive scalability and DevOps tools. I also touch time to time on front web application.

Check out my [manifesto](/page/manifesto) if you want to know more about my motivations, my approach of Computer Sciences, and what exactly is the _GoPex_ initiative.

This blog will serve for code samples and personal project presentation. In its global scope, it will present my journey a random developer to a _DevOps_ capable Software Engineer. __From boring to awesome__.
