I'm Albin Gilles, Software Engineer and DevOps aspirant.

This is my manifesto, introducing the _GoPex_ initiative and my motivations to become a _DevOps capable Software Engineer_.

So... Wtf is this word _Pex_ ?
------------------------------

Let me introduce [GoPex](https://github.com/GoPex) and the _Pex_ concept in a broader picture.

Originally this word, _Pex_, comes from my (not so short) time playing _World Of Warcrat_. A French neologism, _Pexer_, _Aller gagner de l'exp√©rience_. Literally, to go gain experience, or the action to gather experience point in a role playing game.

We started shortened this sentence as we used it a lot (who doesn't like to level up and gain powerful new skills ?) and It becomes a one verb word only.

_Pexer_ in French or _To Pex_ in English, was born.

In the etymology perspective, for what I remember:

- the _pex_ is the revert form of _exp_, the short version of experience
- the _er_ is the French default verb suffix

GoPex
-----

Coming from, literally, _go pex_ or _let's go pex_.

_GoPex_ is something that is around for a while for me, starting around the time I graduated from the university.

For some of my friends and I, It was the idea of gaining programming and technology skills in order to launch our startup when we would have an incredible ideas later on. To be ready in case an incredible idea would burst out of our minds.

We thougt about a lot of crazy things like a _Google Glass_ application to show live sports stats using augmented reality.

We worked also on more reasonable applications, the most achieved one was a web application in order to help school teacher with their boring administrative work and all of the scoring things

This project nearly released, it was a _Ruby On Rails_ web application and we already had a school ready to use it as beta testers. Unfortunately, for personal reasons (maybe I'll tell you if we meet around a lot of beers), we gave up the project.

After that, I spent all my time for my former company, but nothing for me or for my skills. I was too busy and too focused on my daily work and I had no energy left.

The work environment was really overwhelming and I felt very bad in the end. Since I left them, I'm reviving. And with reviving, comes energy and willingness. To be an actor and not a spectator.

DevOps aspirant
---------------

I want to be part of the new tech world. To join a tech focused and ambitious company where I matter and be part of a of great project. Moving away from all of the bullshit you can find in the average IT department of traditional company. I want to build and deploy [Twelve-Factor Applications](http://12factor.net/).

Tech is supposed to make our life easier no ? Why is this not true for those who use and build it every day ?

I believe developers should work in a painless environment and be allowed to be the laziest people on earth concerning anything that is not creative or business related.

Work environment should be consistent, enjoyable, stateless and __painless__. Test should be quick, automatic and __meaningful__. Deploy should be simple, automatic and __trustworthy__.

I believe customers should have the best user experience without any itches. They must be __respected__: fluidity, transparency, robustness, trust, consistency and resilience should be guaranteed in any circumstances.

In order to achieve all of this, I want to learn and setup _DevOps_ tools and methodology, use them, embrace them. Use these technologies to build robust, reactive, auto-scalable and crash recovery capable systems. In order words, build _self-sufficient_ systems.

There are so many powerful and cool things out there. I'm done working on old release of Eclipse, dealing with jar built in 2004 and with computer that doesn't have enough ram to run the operating system. To work on a computer where you don't even have administrator rights because your employer doesn't trust you. Like you aren't grown up yet.

From boring to awesome
----------------------

For too long, seriously it feel likes it has been an eternity, I've worked for people that didn't care about me or about my ideas. About my vision and how I approach the technology and the job.

From now on, I'll be free. From now on, I'll be beaming at my workplace. From now on I'll be listened, respected and trusted.

To achieve that, I raised the _GoPex_ initiative from the grave and I'm learning new techs stack as much as I can. There is so much to learn and I want to know everything. I feel so much hunger right know, I feel that I can learn a whole dictionary if I had to.

My goal is to join a company that use technology to build things with care, passion and a pixel perfect attitude.

This is my dream and I'll do __anything__ I can to achieve it.
